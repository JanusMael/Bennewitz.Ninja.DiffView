# Progress

## Resume

**Phase 4 — Pane presenter, padding, gutters** of
[plan 00001](plans/00001-side-by-side-diff-control.md) is complete on `main`:
`DiffPanePresenter` hosts the pane's source document and renders a `SideBySideDocument`'s
padding as empty space over it — the Phase 1 spike's mechanism lifted into
`src/DiffView.Avalonia/Padding` — fills rows by kind, draws its own text-band selection and
caret, carries line-number and change-marker gutters, primes the padded heights so two panes
report equal extents before any scrolling, normalises the caret column after `Home` twice, and
treats every decorator as a fault boundary that reports once through `RenderFault` and disables
itself. Its control themes travel with the control; the `DiffView.*` tokens come from the host
include. The demo shows two presenters over the small fixture (or the `--left` / `--right`
files) fed from one Core build, with no scroll sync yet. `AGENTS.md` records the cross-file
contracts. Next is **Phase 5 — Composite control, scroll sync, headers, status strip, theming**
(plan §Phase 5): `SideBySideDiffView`, `ScrollSync`, `DiffPaneHeader`, `DiffStatusStrip` on
`StatusController` lifted from ClaudeForge, the latest-wins build worker, `DiffViewStrings`
behind every string, and the library logging rules. Both ClaudeForge contributions (PR #37 and
PR #38) are merged and the ClaudeForge pin follows the merge (see *Upstreamed to ClaudeForge*).

The theme audit regenerates after a pin bump, in this order:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/ThemeAudit -- compat
```

```bash
dotnet run --project src/ThemeAudit -- report
```

## Phases

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Bootstrap | done | 7 tests across three tiers; trim-check clean; manual dialog/F12 check passed |
| 1 Virtual-padding spike | done — go | 6 headless tests, 1 of them `Perf`; priming batched at 256 |
| 2 Theme-key audit and exhaustive dictionaries | done (ClaudeForge PR #38 merged) | `theme-audit` `report` and `compat` over a JSON configuration; inventories model Default fallback, `StyleInclude`, linked files, code providers and brush opacity; contrast scoring against each variant's own surface; reviewed Fluent→Semi and Simple→Semi mappings; `DiffView.Tokens.axaml` + colour-blind sibling; `docs/theme-audit.md` committed with drift tests; runtime resolution and rendering tests under all ten targets; tool packed as 1.1.0 |
| 3 Core model, probing, search engine | done | `PaneSource`, `TextProbe`, `LineSplitter`, `DiffOptions`, `SimilarityGate`, `DiffDocumentBuilder`, `SideBySideDocument` + `Padding`, `WordDiffCache`, `DiffSearch`; 87 unit tests (seven invariants, every failure path, cache, search) and 4 `Perf` measurements |
| 4 Pane presenter, padding, gutters | done | `DiffPanePresenter` over the source document; `PaddingRun` / `PaddingElement` / `PaddingElementGenerator` / `PaddingHeightPrimer` lifted from the spike; `PaneMetadata` bounds-checked and version-stamped; `DiffLineBackgroundRenderer`, `DiffSelectionRenderer`, `DiffCaretRenderer`, `DiffLineNumberMargin`, `ChangeMarkerMargin`, `DiffBrushes`; the fault boundary with `RenderFault`; caret column normalised after `Home` twice; control themes in `Themes/DiffPanePresenter.axaml`; `AGENTS.md`; 26 headless, pixel and snapshot test cases |
| 5 Composite control, scroll sync, headers, status strip, theming | not started | |
| 6 Word-level highlights and options | not started | |
| 7 Navigation, minimap, connectors, tooltips | not started | |
| 8 Find | not started | |

| 10 Scale, visibility, accessibility | not started | |
| 11 Inline (unified) view | not started | optional |

## Phase 4 verification

| Done-when item | Result |
|---|---|
| Headless: the presenter renders under all ten theme targets with zero binding and resource warnings from the logger bridge | pass: `DiffPanePresenterTests.Renders_under_every_theme_target_with_no_binding_or_resource_warnings` over the ten targets; each pane paints its own `DiffView.PaneBackgroundBrush` under every one, and the bridge saw no warning in any area |
| Headless: each presenter's document text equals its source text exactly — no padding in the document | pass: `The_document_text_equals_the_source_text_and_the_line_counts_agree`, both sides, character for character |
| Headless: on the mixed-line-ending fixture, `DiffPane.Lines` count equals the presenter's `TextDocument.LineCount` | pass: `The_model_and_the_editor_count_the_same_lines_on_mixed_line_endings` — CRLF, CR and LF in one text, five lines both ways, the `MixedLineEndings` warning raised |
| Headless: after a load both presenters report equal scroll extents before any scrolling, and the renderer receives the expected `Kind` per visual line | pass: `After_a_load_both_extents_are_equal_before_scrolling_and_the_renderer_sees_each_lines_kind` — a 200 px viewport keeps one padded line below it; both extents equal the row count times the line height, every shared row sits at the same top, the background renderer and the marker margin report each visible line's own kind and padding, and a font change to 18 px re-primes with the extents still equal. `Assigning_a_new_model_reprimes_so_lines_that_lost_their_padding_return_to_one_row` covers the union rule on a model swap |
| Headless: the line-number margin shows the document's own numbers and nothing over padding space | pass: `The_line_number_margin_shows_the_documents_own_numbers_and_nothing_over_padding_space` — numbers in visual-line order at each line's text top; the margin's pixels over the padding rows are the gutter background only, the text row carries the number |
| Headless: no `SearchPanel` is installed on the presenter | pass: `No_search_panel_is_installed` — no search input handler nested in the text area, and Ctrl+F leaves the panel closed |
| Headless: the presenter honours `IsReadOnly` — typing is rejected when true and accepted when false | pass: `IsReadOnly_is_honoured_and_defaults_to_true` — the default is true; headless text input changes nothing until the flag is cleared |
| Headless: with metadata for a shorter document, every line renders as `Unchanged` and nothing throws | pass: `Metadata_for_a_different_document_renders_unknown_lines_as_unchanged_and_never_throws` — a longer document keeps the known lines' kinds and renders the rest unchanged and unpadded; a shorter one renders every line it has; no fault either way (the reading is in `DECISIONS.md`) |
| Headless: a renderer that throws raises `RenderFault` once, disables itself, and the text is still rendered; a generator that throws does the same and the line renders without padding | pass: `A_throwing_renderer_raises_RenderFault_once_disables_itself_and_the_text_still_renders`, `A_throwing_generator_raises_RenderFault_once_and_the_lines_render_without_padding` — one fault each over two frames, glyphs still drawn, every line one row tall after the generator fault; a new model re-enables the generator |
| Pixel assertions: inserted and deleted text bands and padding space carry their theme brushes; a selection across a padded line paints only text bands; the caret on a padded line is one text line tall | pass: `PresenterPixelTests.Inserted_and_deleted_rows_and_padding_space_carry_their_theme_brushes` (row bands match the composited token colours; the padding rows carry the fill and the hatch), `A_selection_across_a_padded_line_paints_only_text_bands_and_the_caret_is_one_text_line_tall` (selection in both text bands, none in the padding rows; caret in the padded line's text band only, gone when the other pane takes focus) |
| Snapshot: the small fixture in light and dark | pass: `PresenterSnapshotTests.Small_fixture_renders` under Semi Light and Dark at 900×600, reviewed and approved; the demo smoke snapshot re-approved with the two panes in it |
| The caret column after `Home` twice, owed by Phase 1 | pass: `Home_pressed_twice_on_a_padded_line_keeps_the_caret_on_the_first_text_column` — the second `Home` lands on column 1 at visual column 1, and `Right` moves to column 2 |
| Automation names on the new surface | the two margins carry names through `DiffViewStrings` (`Margins_carry_automation_names_through_the_string_resolver`); the demo's panes are named; the accessibility guard counts `DiffPanePresenter` and `TextEditor` |
| `AGENTS.md` started with the first cross-file contracts | done: the metadata stamp, the no-worker rule, `SearchPanel.Uninstall()`, the priming triggers, the fault boundary, the padding geometry, the theming rules and the test seams |
| `dotnet build DiffView.slnx -warnaserror` | clean |
| `dotnet test --solution DiffView.slnx` | 215 passed |
| New headless tests proven able to fail | the extents test failed one padding row short before `OnLoaded` became a priming trigger — the defect it was written to catch, and one the 320 px hosts of the other tests hid; the selection test failed while it sampled an empty padded line and the bands test while its sample band still held glyphs, before their fixtures were corrected |
| Trimmed publish (`linux-x64`, self-contained) | succeeds, 0 IL warnings, 50 MB; the first draft's runtime `ResourceInclude` failed it with IL2026 and became the compiled `DiffPanePresenterTheme` (see `DECISIONS.md`) |
| Demo launched on this machine | boots, builds the bundled pair (33 rows, 5 blocks, no warnings) and shows both panes; no fault or error in the log |

## Phase 3 verification

| Done-when item | Result |
|---|---|
| Invariant 1 — every line of each side appears exactly once in `Rows`, in order | pass on seven pairs (small, generated 1000-line, identical, empty left, empty right, both empty, no trailing terminator); the pane's row pointers agree with the table and the line count is the editor's |
| Invariant 2 — no row has both sides `null` | pass, and each kind has exactly the sides it implies |
| Invariant 3 — a modified row's pieces concatenate to its lines | pass on every modified row of every pair, in word and character mode, and on edge lines (empty sides, separators only, trailing space) |
| Invariant 4 — blocks disjoint, ordered, covering every changed row, with exact per-side ranges | pass; an empty range sits where the side's next line would go |
| Invariant 5 — `Cr`, `CrLf`, `Lf` variants produce identical rows | pass on a 300-line pair with changes |
| Invariant 6 — `Padding.Before` summed plus `Padding.Trailing` equals the side's `null` rows | pass on every pair; padding before a line equals the run of `null` rows above it |
| Invariant 7 — below the floor on large inputs: unaligned concatenation, `Aligned` false, `TooDifferentToAlign` | pass on a 6,000-line unrelated pair over a 10,000-line threshold; `ForceAlignment` and a higher threshold align it; a small unrelated pair aligns regardless |
| Identical inputs → no blocks; empty left / empty right; binary → `BinaryInput`; mixed and CR-only endings → `MixedLineEndings`; Latin-1 fallback warned; long line → `LongLinesSkipped` and no pieces; cancellation between stages | pass — an empty side is one empty line that pairs with the other side's first line as modified (see `DECISIONS.md`) |
| `WordDiffCache` returns the same instance twice, evicts by LRU, keys by document version | pass |
| Search: scope filtering; `Both` ordering (row, left, column); whole word at line boundaries; `ChangedRowsOnly`; invalid regex → `Error`; catastrophic backtracking → timeout `Error`; `Truncated` above `MaxMatches`; cancellation | pass; a backreference pattern runs on the fallback engine; a pane text shorter than the document is tolerated |
| `Perf`: `Build` on the 10k and 200k pairs; the gate on the unrelated pair | measured, see *Measurements* |
| `dotnet build DiffView.slnx -warnaserror` | clean |
| `dotnet test --solution DiffView.slnx` | 189 passed |
| Tests proven able to fail | the search fixture, the small-pair block expectation and the default-options static initialiser each failed a run during the phase before the code or the expectation was corrected |
| Trimmed publish (`linux-x64`, self-contained) | succeeds, 0 IL warnings, 48 MB |

## Phase 2 verification

| Done-when item | Result |
|---|---|
| `theme-audit report` from a clean directory produces the report against the reference checkouts | pass: `dotnet run --project src/ThemeAudit -- report` writes `docs/theme-audit.md` (4 themes, 6 consumers); `--check` confirms it |
| `dotnet pack` puts `Bennewitz.Ninja.ThemeAudit` in the local feed | pass: `scripts/pack-theme-audit.*` packs 1.1.0 into `../nuget-local` |
| `tests/ThemeAudit.Tests` passes on fixture themes, including one that omits a key and one whose token fails its floor | pass: `Fixtures/audit` (Host omits `HostAccent` under Dark; `AppOwn` fails 4.5 in Dark) and `Fixtures/compat` |
| `docs/theme-audit.md` committed; regenerating changes nothing | pass: `ReferenceAuditTests.The_committed_report_equals_a_fresh_run` and the compat sibling; a mismatch writes a `.received` file beside the committed one |
| Resolution: with the compat dictionary every AvaloniaEdit theme key resolves under all six Semi variants; without it the test names the missing keys | pass, static and at runtime: with compat 0 missing; without, the Fluent theme file lacks 6 keys (`ContentControlThemeFontFamily`, `ControlContentThemeFontSize`, `SystemAccentColor`, `SystemBaseLowColor`, `SystemChromeMediumColor`, `ToolTipBorderThemeThickness`) and the Simple theme file 9 — the plan's "six" counted only the Fluent file |
| Contrast: every `DiffView.*` pair meets its floor under all ten targets | pass: 30 pairs × 10 targets, both palettes, 0 below the floor, 0 unmeasurable |
| Headless: a plain `TextEditor` renders under each Semi variant with the compat dictionary and no resource warning | pass: `ThemeResolutionTests.A_TextEditor_with_its_Fluent_search_panel_renders_under_Semi_with_the_compat_dictionary`, six variants, search panel open and painted, no binding warning |
| ClaudeForge pull request open and referenced here | pass: [JanusMael/ClaudeForge#38](https://github.com/JanusMael/ClaudeForge/pull/38), draft — see *Upstreamed to ClaudeForge* |
| `dotnet build DiffView.slnx -warnaserror` | clean |
| `dotnet test --solution DiffView.slnx` | 102 passed |
| New headless tests proven able to fail | removing the compat include from the `TextEditor` test failed it (the Fluent theme's static references throw at load) before the include was restored |
| Trimmed publish (`linux-x64`, self-contained) | succeeds, 0 IL warnings; the compat dictionaries and tokens compile into `DiffView.Avalonia` |

## Phase 1 verification

| Item | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Padding above a line and after the last line, height exactly `(k + 1) · lineHeight` | `Item1_padding_run_pads_above_a_line_and_after_the_last_line_by_whole_rows` | pass: 4 rows for 3 above, 5 rows for 4 trailing, text row centred as a plain line's; glyph pixels only in the text row |
| 2 Caret skips the zero-length element; click in padding lands on the adjacent line | `Item2_caret_skips_the_padding_element_and_a_click_in_padding_lands_on_the_adjacent_line` | pass: Right, Left, Up, Down, End, Home move one position per press; clicks in padding above, at x = 0, and in trailing padding land on the right line |
| 3 Priming equalises extents before any scrolling; survives `Redraw`; re-primes after `Document` and `FontSize` change | `Item3_height_priming_equalises_extents_before_scrolling_and_survives_redraw_document_swap_and_font_change` | pass: extents differ before priming (94 vs 90 rows), equal 99 rows after, every shared row at the same top |
| 4 Own selection and caret over transparent editor brushes paint only text bands | `Item4_selection_and_caret_drawn_from_text_extents_paint_only_text_bands` | pass: no selection or caret pixels in three padding rows; both present in the text rows |
| 5 1:1 offset sync at top, middle and bottom | `Item5_offset_sync_is_one_to_one_at_top_middle_and_bottom` | pass: equal maximum offsets, equal first visible row, every shared row aligned at all three offsets |
| 6 Priming cost for 10k gaps | `Item6_priming_cost_for_ten_thousand_gaps` (`Category=Perf`) | measured: see below |
| `dotnet build DiffView.slnx -warnaserror` | | clean |
| `dotnet test --solution DiffView.slnx` | | 12 passed (7 from Phase 0, 5 spike); the `Perf` test is excluded by default and passes with `-p:IncludePerfTests=true` |
| New tests proven able to fail | | a temporary `Assert.Fail` at the top of item 1 failed the run before removal |
| Trimmed publish (`linux-x64`, self-contained) | | succeeds, 0 IL warnings, 48 MB; no shipped code changed in this phase |

## Phase 0 verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `dotnet build DiffView.slnx -warnaserror` | clean |
| `dotnet test --solution DiffView.slnx` | 7 passed: 1 Core unit, 3 ThemeAudit unit, 1 accessibility guard, 2 rendered smoke snapshots (Semi light and dark) |
| Headless host renders | `CaptureRenderedFrame()` returns an 800×500 frame; both snapshots verified |
| Demo boots under Semi and under Fluent | launched on this Wayland session with `--theme semi` and `--theme fluent`; the log shows the flags summary, `Starting`, the log directory and `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` |
| Trimmed publish (`linux-x64`, self-contained, `TrimMode=link`) | succeeds, 0 IL warnings, 48 MB output, boots and logs |
| Reference self-heal | removing `reference/DiffPlex` and building the Avalonia test project re-fetched it at its pin; `git status` shows nothing under `reference/` but the manifest and README |
| `theme-audit inventory` on Semi Light | 624 keys in 44 files; the tool packs into the local feed |
| Deliberate throw → dialog, F12 live log | **pass** at the window, Debug build and trimmed publish (user, 2026-09-04): the dialog shows with a working copy button and F12 opens the live log. Found: F12 pressed inside the live-log window did not close it, because the toggle lived on the main window's key handler only; fixed upstream in the diagnostics package (see *Upstreamed*) and consumed as 1.0.1 |

## Upstreamed to ClaudeForge

| Change | Reference | State |
|---|---|---|
| Live-log window ignored F12 (toggle lived on the host's main window only); and `LayeredEditors.Avalonia.Diagnostics` named a `PackageReadmeFile` it did not ship, so `dotnet pack` failed | [JanusMael/ClaudeForge#37](https://github.com/JanusMael/ClaudeForge/pull/37) | merged as `99c2963`; consumed here as diagnostics 1.0.1 — the merged source is identical to the packed branch head `f7980f2`, so the package did not change; the pin in `reference/sources.json` moved to `93065ba`, main's tip after both merges |
| Theme audit: the report for ClaudeForge's views (seven `SystemControl*` keys still referenced and undefined under Semi, one of them — `SystemAccentColorBrush` — defined by no theme at all), the generated `FluentKeys.Semi.axaml` / `SimpleKeys.Semi.axaml` merged in its `App.axaml`, the tool as a local dotnet tool, and the `docs/UI-STYLE-GUIDE.md` §2 update | [JanusMael/ClaudeForge#38](https://github.com/JanusMael/ClaudeForge/pull/38) | merged as `93065ba` after the user's click-through; `docs/theme-audit.md` regenerated against the merged checkout — ClaudeForge's own copies of the compat dictionaries now count as consumer-defined keys, leaving `SystemAccentColorBrush` as its one undefined key under Semi |
